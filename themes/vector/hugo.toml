This blog is my way of documenting the journey: the highs, the struggles, and the invaluable lessons along the way. Iâ€™ll be sharing study notes, tips, and reflections to keep myself on track and, hopefully, to help anyone else navigating a similar path. Thanks for stopping byâ€”explore, learn, and feel free to connect. Let's Talk About Networking Stuff. Enjoy! ðŸ™‚"
