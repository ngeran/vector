>Before the router even starts the route selection process it needs to make sure that the route is valid, checks the **Martian** routes, **AS loops** and **next-hop reachability**. 

## Best Path Selection

| Attribute                        | Preference   | Default Behavior                                    |
| :------------------------------- | :----------  | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Route Preference              | Lowest       | Default value is 170                                |
| 2. Local Preference              | Highest      | Default learned value is 100                        |
| 3. AS-Path                       | Shortest     | Usualy the first time route selection occurs        |
| 4. Origin                        | Lowest       | IGP (I) >  EGP (E), EGP > incomplete (?)            |
| 5. Multi Exit Discriminator (MED)| Lowest       | Compared when routes are learned from the same AS   |
| 6. Route Type                    | External     | Internal vs External, External prefered             |
| 7. IGP Cost                      | Lowest       | lowest cost towards the BGP next-hop                |
| 8. Internal vs External          | Lowest       | Lowest R-ID,  Oldest active route                   |
| 10. Cluster List                 | Shortest     | When route reflection is used                       |
| 11. Peer IP Address              | Lowest       | Multiple peerings between the same router           |
